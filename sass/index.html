        <h1>Who is "Gaipak Design"?</h1>
        <p>We have been helping people in Los Angeles / San Fernando Valley for 5 years navigate through the kitchen and bathroom design decisions helping to make your home improvement project a rewarding activity that will be cherished for years to come.</p>
        <p>
            We do not look at a home improvement project an investment of money as much as we look at it as an opportunity to improve one’s life, one day at a time. <br>
There is nothing more rewarding than enjoying our homes at the end of a long day.
