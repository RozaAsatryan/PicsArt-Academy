        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <div class="wd400">
          <p>We founded Paper Mania in 2014. One day we realized that we didn't want to wrap gifts for our loved ones in low-quality, old-fashioned bags. That's when the idea came to mind to create our own. Originally a small workshop, where we created Kraft bags for gifts and souvenirs, in subsequent years we have developed into a company that produces not only bags, but also wrapping paper, boxes, paper accessories for packaging.
